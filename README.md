AI/ML engineer shipping production systems. I build end-to-end ML pipelines—data → training/evals → low-latency inference & monitoring—with interests in computer vision, NLP, RAG/agents, and MLOps.  
**Stack:** Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, scikit-learn, FastAPI, vector DBs, Docker/Kubernetes, AWS/GCP/Azure, GitHub Actions.  
Always learning, always building—PRs welcome.
